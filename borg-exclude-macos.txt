# These are exclusions for borg backup which are particular to macOS
# Use: borg create --patterns-from=/path/to/borg-exclude.txt

# N.B. --patterns-from uses the shell style of patterns by default NOT the fn
# Shell style counts ** as any character (including path separators)

# A directory exclusion pattern can end either with or without a slash (‘/’).
# If it ends with a slash, such as some/path/, the directory will be included but not its content.
# If it does not end with a slash, such as some/path, both the directory and content will be excluded.
# A minus sign will exclude, but still recurse into the directory to find inclusions (slow)
# A bang/exclamation point will _not_ recurse into a directory, and thus no inclusion rules will kick in (dangerous)

# N.B. Other directories will be ignored if a file '.nobackup' is present and '--exclude-if-present .nobackup' is used

## We use ** here because macOS will use System/Volumes/Data/Applications/ as well
## You could just exclude both, as the deduplication would take care of it, but faster to skip
